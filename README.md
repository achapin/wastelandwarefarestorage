# Wasteland Warefare Storage

This is a papercraft box I made to store sleeved mini-side cards for Fallout Wasteland Warfare. The dividers on page 2 can be placed on the inside of the box at the dotted lines to prevent the cards from falling over and getting jumbled if the box isn't yet full. I've found that three of these fit perfectly inside the FWW Core set box, with some room to spare.
